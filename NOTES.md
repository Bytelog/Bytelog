Thoughts, articles, and tutorials that I have written
with the intent of public exposure. I encourage you to read with an open
mind and discuss.

  This is an approximation        Title of Article - February 6th
  of a thought. From Twitter      Here is a sample description of the article. It
                                  should be fairly short.
  Here is another thought
                                  Another Article - January 31st, 2015
  And a final thought. Perhaps    Yet another description! Should I hard cap the
  I should also share tweets?     character limit?
